# HalfStalk readme

## Who are we?
We are three students taking a course in Open Source. As a part of this course we are tasked to develop an Open Source project. We have decided to try our hands on a simple 2D isometric video game.

## What is HalfStalk?
Our game is inspired by the setting and mood in games such as S.T.A.L.K.E.R and Half-Life, thus the working title HalfStalk. 

## What’s the story?
Our game follows a lonely scientist as they investigate the mysterious area they find themselves in. The player starts out in a barren landscape filled with “zombies” and must travel to the source of the mystery. To do so, they will fight off enemies, navigate dangerous areas and solve puzzles to progress. On their journey the player will find clues to piece together the story of what caused this strange area to become what it has. 

## How can I help?
We are developing this game in the Open Source game engine GoDot. So to contribute to this project you will first need to download it (no installation required). 
You can find the download here: https://godotengine.org/ (select the standard version)

We are doing our work in the dev branch, while the master branch is reserved for stable versions of the game. 
To work on the project you can make a fork of our repository or clone it. 
Once downloaded, you run the Godot engine.
Press “import” and navigate your way to the source files, select the “project.godot” file and press “open”.
You are now set to work on or test the project.

## Other useful software
Should you like to add art and graphics to the game, you may look into the digital painting application Krita (this is what we are using)
This is an open source program, and you can find it here: https://krita.org/

## What do we need?
#### Testing
What we are looking for in this project is mainly testers.
If you’d like to help us out, you can follow the instructions in the section above to download it and run it. 
If you encounter any bugs, crashes or issues please create an issue on the repository project and label it accordingly. 

#### Bug Fixing
Although testing is our main concern, you are free to try your hands at any issues in the repository project. Bug Fixing will be particularly useful.

#### Suggestions and general feedback
Lastly, any suggestions you may have are more than welcome. We are inexperienced game developers, and any input or feedback will be greatly appreciated.
